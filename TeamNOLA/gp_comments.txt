Team NOLA:
-Issues with data - both loading, downloading
-Developed a mapping application using the ArcGIS online platform
-Used 90th percentile hot and cold events based  AvgRel 3 and 4 indices  - double index for the win!
-Counted number of days in area over the past 4 years
-4 consecutive days in a row over 90%, 2 consecutive days over 95%
-Wow - the world has chicken pox!
-Used the indexes over the entire historical data series and full population data set!

GP Questions:
- How do the two indices compare (numerically), what useful insights might you derive from the differences?
- How do envision an aid agency or municipality to use this data to improve their understanding of heat stress?
