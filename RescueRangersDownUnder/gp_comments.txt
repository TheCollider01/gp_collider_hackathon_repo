Rescue Rangers Down Under:
-Issues with data - loading
-Limited scope to Australia to focus on problem statement
-Established 90th, 95th, 98th percentiles for 10 cities in Aus.
-Forecast from March 17 -> end of 2019
-NASA SEDAC: vulnerable population <14 and >65
-Calculated number of times of each city exceeded each percentile in the forecast
-SE Australia exceeds the threshold more frequently
-Assessed regions with population density of vulnerable groups
-No intuitive insight: Newcastle expected to experience extreme heat - who knew!?

GP Questions:
-How would an agency incorporate this index into their decision making?
-Do you believe the forecast data?  Why?
