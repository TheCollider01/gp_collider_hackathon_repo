No name team:
-Issues with data - loading
-Couldn't get all of the data until the last hour, too late to investigate thoroughly :(
-Data challenges left time to develop a framework to define vulnerable population and index
-Reviewed public health data to establish that minimum temperature also contributes heavily to heat impact
-Duration is important metric -> exponential impact
-Developed framework using daily duration but, couldn't implement because the forecast data was 5 day
-Primary factors for index: Socioeconomic, physiological, health service access, medical conditions
-Envisioned App: Map with location and sliders for each index factor
-Retrospective data analysis was on the default values - in the end identified 670 days that would have exceeded thresholds
-No time to incorporate Forecast :(

GP Questions:
-How would you develop default values for the sliders?
-How could you validate the 670 days the index was exceeded?  Where these real heatwaves?
